Instructions:
alright we want to be able to scrape some data off the iea website I've included some scripts that pull electricity data for refrence , there is a url bellow and the html associated with the button.
we're looking to pull the oil usage data for only oecd countries you can look at "cars_on_the_road.csv" if you need a list
I've included "International Energy Agency - oil final consumption by product in Canada.csv" so you can update test to make sure you're getting the correct data

once you're done updating run the test script
Run the full scrape script
stop and have me verify the data is there
put all data into a sqlite db for ease of use
Stop and have me check your work

stop and remind me to recopy the code from my electricity visualization project
visualization I'll bring over some code from a different project we'll update it so that it works with this one
    a. works with this new data
    b. we show a heatmap of whatever indicator is selected 
    c. the indicators on the left hand side we can select and change the heatmap
    d. the side panel graph will be changed to something like a kaya index with the identity gasoline = pop * cars/pop * km/veh * gasoline/km
    e. I'd like this to be able to be changed to an indexed value where the user can change the base year. both of these will be dropdowns near the top by country

2. Lets split what we just did up from what we're about to do with a button near             <!-- Detail Panel -->...<h2 id="country-name"></h2> that toggles betwen raw data, efficiency, and forecast.
    1. under historical data lets leave consumption by product the same, electrification leave the same. 
        we'll want to include category mix (suv's,trucks,cars,motorcycles,freight) you can use the methods for electrification for this,
        change up the variables component: have raw data on number of cars, population,  total gasoline, fuel(gasoline+Diesel), total Diesel total kilometers driven
        add new graph using derived features: fuel efficiency, km's driven, km/car, cars/capita
    2. We want to visualize the efficiency gain here. we're going to want 
        a. stacked bar chart of 'total fuel not used' that incorparates:
            fuel efficiency( over time fleets become more efficient),
            electrification(mpg ice vs 0 for electric),
            rates of car ownership(increasing in korea but decreasing across most of oecd)
            population increases(extensive margin)
        b.Let's make an efficiency line graph based 
            a. electrification as 80% of the passenger fleet 20% of freight
            b. average suv (we're going to need benchmarks in different regions: america's(include: AUS,NZL,CAN,USA),Europe,Asia,Brazil on it's own)
            c. average sedan (we're going to need benchmarks in different regions: america's(include: AUS,NZL,CAN,USA),Europe,Asia,Brazil on it's own)
            d. observed fuel efficiency of whole fleet

    3. Forecast/ simulate - this is for v1 please make design choices that will allow us to play with the graph elements in v2
        a. predict total gasoline demand based on projections (create a table in the db for this)
            i. assume continued trends
                - population growth (I'll grab these from world bank)
                - sigmoid growth in EV'sales
                - fuel efficiency of new vehicles will improve at the same rate as the past 10 yeaar average
                - car ownership will change at the same rate as the past 10 years
            ii. plot these as a stacked bar chart similar to what we did above
        b. per capita metrics of each
        c.Let's make an efficiency line graph similar to above
            a. electrification as 80% of the passenger fleet 20% of freight
            b. average suv 
                -we're going to need benchmarks in different regions: america's(include: AUS,NZL,CAN,USA),Europe,Asia,Brazil on it's own
                - used forecasted value from chart 3.a
            c. average sedan 
                -we're going to need benchmarks in different regions: america's(include: AUS,NZL,CAN,USA),Europe,Asia,Brazil on it's own
                - used forecasted value from chart 3.a
            d. forecasted fuel efficiency of fleet combining the forecasted ev's, vehicle sales and retirements
