This is a project blake suggested

gasoline = pop * cars/pop * km/veh * gasoline/km

so break this down by country to look at what is happenin

Instructions:
alright we want to be able to scrape some data off the iea website I've included some scripts that pull electricity data for refrence , there is a url bellow and the html associated with the button.
we're looking to pull the oil usage data for only oecd countries you can look at "cars_on_the_road.csv" if you need a list
I've included "International Energy Agency - oil final consumption by product in Canada.csv" so you can update test to make sure you're getting the correct data

once you're done updating run the test script
Run the full scrape script
stop and have me verify the data is there
put all data into a sqlite db for ease of use
Stop and have me check your work

stop and remind me to recopy the code from my electricity visualization project
visualization I'll bring over some code from a different project we'll update it so that it works with this one
    a. works with this new data
    b. we show a heatmap of whatever indicator is selected 
    c. the indicators on the left hand side we can select and change the heatmap
    d. the side panel graph will be changed to something like a kaya index with the identity gasoline = pop * cars/pop * km/veh * gasoline/km
    e. I'd like this to be able to be changed to an indexed value where the user can change the base year. both of these will be dropdowns near the top by country
